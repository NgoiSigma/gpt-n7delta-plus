### Symbol Use Notice

Symbols and glyphs included in this project (e.g. Σ‑FDL glyphs, logos, sacred signs) are offered under the **Symbol Use Notice** from the Σ‑FDL CodeX.  These symbols may only be used in open, ethical systems and must not be incorporated into closed or exploitative technologies.  Their integrity must be preserved: do not alter or deface the symbols, and always include proper attribution.

## Ethical Manifesto (FDL)

The **Formal Dialectical Logic (FDL)** at the heart of NOVEYA demands that software and content be created and used in ways that uphold light, justice and resonance.  In practical terms:

- **Respect the Commons:** Contributions should enrich the shared knowledge base. Any enhancements or derivatives must remain open under the same license (AGPL‑3.0 for code, CC‑BY‑NC‑SA 4.0 for non‑code).  Commercialization of these works is prohibited without explicit permission.
- **No Exploitation:** This code and its associated symbols must not be used for surveillance, oppression, or other exploitative activities.  Applications that undermine human rights or ecological balance are strictly forbidden.
- **Transparency & Attribution:** Always credit the original authors and the Σ‑FDL framework when reusing or remixing this material.  Disclose any modifications.
- **Maintaining Resonance:** When integrating these components into larger systems, ensure that the ethical principles of FDL—harmony, balance, and the pursuit of collective well‑being—remain intact.  Systems built upon this work should be interoperable and support the broader NOVEYA ecosystem.

By using, contributing to or distributing this repository, you agree to abide by these licenses and ethical guidelines. If you need an exception (e.g. commercial use of non‑code assets), please contact the NOVEYA maintainers.

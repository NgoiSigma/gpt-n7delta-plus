# Cover Letter

Dear Partner/Grant Committee,

We are excited to present our project and mission. This cover letter outlines the vision behind our work and invites collaboration and support.

Our initiative aims to build resonant AI services grounded in formal dialectical logic (FDL) and ethical considerations. We believe in transparent decision‑making, open cooperation, and fair reciprocity. The FDL Agent Kernel integrates semantic routing, token engine management and ethical guardrails while remaining fully open source under the AGPL‑3.0‑or‑later license.

We invite you to join us in shaping a responsible AI future. Through partnerships, contributions and feedback we can accelerate development and broaden the impact of our platform.

Sincerely,

NGOI‑SIGMA / Fravahr Ormazd

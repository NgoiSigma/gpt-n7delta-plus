# GPT-N7Δ+ Core

Welcome to the core repository of **GPT‑N7Δ+**, the harmonic semantic agent.

## About

GPT‑N7Δ+ is part of the N7 semantic architecture. This core repository contains:

- **`manifest.json`** – the manifest file describing the project.
- **`fdl_token_engine.py`** – a simple FDL token engine skeleton (to be extended).

The project aims to create a resonant FDL token engine for generative agents and to explore synthesis of technology and consciousness.
